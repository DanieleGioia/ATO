class Scenario_reducer():
    '''
    Abstract class for a scenario reducer that,
    given a fixed n, reduces an original set of scenarios
    with cardinality N to a smaller one of cardinality n.

    Different strategies can vary w.r.t.:
    -The metrics (Wass 1,2,inf..)
    -The selection order (Fast forward, backward, simultaneous backward)

    We assume a discrete uniform initial distribution on the scenarios.
    It can be generalized by appending a new value in the init of another sub-class
